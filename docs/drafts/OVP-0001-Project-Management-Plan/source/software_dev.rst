Software Development Management
===============================
We will use a variety of best practices and procedures to develop high quality software.

Software development process
----------------------------
No software development process has been chosen.  As the project is currently in the design/research and development stage it is too early to define a software development methodology. 

As the project matures and community participation increases, we will probably choose Agile for software development and a form of waterfall for hardware development.

Software development tools
--------------------------

Given the focus of supporting multiple hardware platforms for experimentation, a number of compilers will be utilized to generate code.

This section will change as the needs and requirements become clearer.

Tools
^^^^^
Source code editors.  Developers may use whatever IDE or text editor(s) they prefer.  Industry best practice is no longer to specify a specific IDE, but instead focus attention on code formatting.

Compilers.  Compilers and cross chosen will be based on the target platform to be executed on. 

Initially, GitHub will be used to track issues and bugs, and provide project management capabilities to the project.

Obsolescence management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We intend to manage the obsolescence of software development tools:

-	Upgrading where absolutely necessary, or such upgrade provides a clear benefit to the project.


Software development rules and standards
----------------------------------------

Software development standards, rules, coding style guides, UML usage will be specified in a separate document.
